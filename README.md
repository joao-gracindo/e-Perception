This repository was developed to save some archives related to the e-Perception project. 

The e-Perception software is a tutoring system for aural skills training. It has some excercises for musical intervals detection organized by levels, as a game.

We're developing this software in an academic context. So, it is a outcome from an ongoing research.

The software is already published at playstore. You can find it searching for "e-Perception".
